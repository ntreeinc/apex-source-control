# apex-source-control
Introducing file-based version-control for Oracle Application Express apps!

* Designed to be used by teams who want to bring their experience in version-control and APEX development together
* Any version-control tool can be used, not just git
* Tested on Linux and OSX (Windows not supported)

## Getting Started
Prerequisites:
* Oracle SQLcl on the path (https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/appdev/sqlcl.html)

If you don't/can't use SQLcl, this also still supports the legacy tools from APEX 5.  To use them instead of sqlcl, you require:
* APEXExport.class and APEXExportSplitter.class which come with [APEX 5.0] (http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/developer-tools/apex/downloads/index.html) and above
* An `export APEX_HOME` with `$APEX_HOME/utilities/oracle/apex/*.class` being the location of the above mentioned files
* An installation of [Oracle Instant Client](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/features/instant-client/index-100365.html)
* An `export ORACLE_HOME` with an existing `$ORACLE_HOME/jdbc/lib/jdbc6.jar` (likely included in installation of Oracle Instant Client)
* `sqlplus` on path

## Usage
#### Bring an existing APEX app into source control

1) Make a local directory for your app and in the new directory run `npm init` and follow the given prompts

2) Add the following lines to your devDependencies in package.json (Note: delete or repurpose the pre-existing scripts value)
```
"scripts": {
   "apex-to-file" : "apex-source-control apex-to-file",
   "file-to-apex" : "apex-source-control file-to-apex",
   "new-conf-file" : "apex-source-control new-conf-file",
   "switch-conf-file" : "apex-source-control switch-conf-file",
   "read-conf-file" : "apex-source-control read-conf-file",
   "generate-app-id" : "apex-source-control generate-app-id",
   "uninstall-apex" : "apex-source-control uninstall-apex"
},
```
If you want you can change the npm run commands (under scripts) to anything you'd like.

3) Run the following commands and follow the prompts. The app id, parsing_schema, workspace_name and database connection info should all correspond to the app you want to download (see <a href="#configuration">Configuration</a>)
```
npm install --save-dev apex-source-control
npm run new-conf-file 		#create a config file with the info of the app you want to download
npm run switch-conf-file 	#unnecessary if you choose to switch to your new config file in npm run in previous command
npm run apex-to-file 		#download the app locally
```
You can now set up the application as a git or other version-control repository. Be warned that if you downloaded the app from another developer's copy of the app, or some other version of the app you don't want to overwrite, you should create a new config file and set up a new version of the application.

#### Setting up from an APEX export file

1) Make a local directory for your app and in the new directory run `npm init` and follow the given prompts

2) Add the following lines to your devDependencies in package.json (Note: delete or repurpose the pre-existing scripts value)
```
"scripts": {
   "apex-to-file" : "apex-source-control apex-to-file",
   "file-to-apex" : "apex-source-control file-to-apex",
   "new-conf-file" : "apex-source-control new-conf-file",
   "switch-conf-file" : "apex-source-control switch-conf-file",
   "read-conf-file" : "apex-source-control read-conf-file",
   "generate-app-id" : "apex-source-control generate-app-id",
   "uninstall-apex" : "apex-source-control uninstall-apex"
},
```
If you want you can change the npm run commands (under scripts) to anything you'd like (see <a href="#npm-scripts-commands">npm scripts Commands</a>).

3) Run `npm install --save-dev apex-source-control`

4) Copy the export file into your project directory

5) Set up your classpath and run APEXExportSplitter on the export file
```
export CLASSPATH=$APEX_HOME/utilities:$ORACLE_HOME/jdbc/lib/ojdbc6.jar
java oracle.apex.APEXExportSplitter $export_file
```	
The CLASSPATH variable does not need to be added to your bash profile

6) Rename the generated directory to apex/

7) cd into apex/ and run `sed -i 's^@application^@apex/application^g' install.sql`

We do this because we need to set the relative path to the install components from the top level directory

8) Remove the old `$export_file` or place it in a different directory

From here you can now either set up the project as a git/subversion/etc. repository or install into apex using:
```
npm run new-conf-file
npm run switch-conf-file #unnecessary if you choose to switch to your new config file in npm run new-conf-file
npm run file-to-apex
```
## Working with existing apex-source-control project

1) Clone the repository locally

2) Use `npm install` to install dependencies

3) Run the following commands and follow the prompts. This will set up your config file and put the application into your APEX workspace
```
npm run new-conf-file 		#create config file with the info of the app you want to use for version control
npm run switch-conf-file 	#unnecessary if you choose to switch to your new config file in npm run new-conf-file
npm run file-to-apex 		#download the app locally
```
That's it!

When you run `npm run new-conf-file` you can either enter the info of the app you are already using to develop (your version will be overwritten by the one in version control) or enter in the info of a non-existent app which will be automatically created after running `npm run file-to-apex` (see <a href="#configuration">Configuration</a>).

## npm scripts Commands
Note: You can change these commands to anything you like by editing the scripts value of `package.json`.
For example if you replaced `"apex-to-file" : "apex-source-control apex-to-file"` with `"atf" : "apex-source-control apex-to-file"` then your new command would be `npm run atf`.
##### npm run apex-to-file
Turn your apex workspace project into a file directory suitable for version control tools.
##### npm run file-to-apex
Import your file directory into apex as an apex application.
Will overwrite any existing app in the same workspace with the same id.

This command will only work with a $PROJECT_HOME/apex/ dir which was generated by `npm run apex-to-file` or is setup as described in steps 6 to 8 of <a href="#setting-up-from-an-apex-export-file">Setting up from an APEX export file</a>.
##### npm run uninstall-apex
Uninstall your app from apex
##### npm run new-conf-file
Creates a new config file using user input. 
##### npm run switch-conf-file
Switches the symlink to the config file of user's choice
##### npm run read-conf-file
Outputs the name and contents of the config file currently being used
##### npm run generate-app-id
Logs into your database and automatically generates an unused app-id.
Used in order to avoid accidentaly overwritting someone else's app.
Can only be run if your config file is set up with proper database login info (see <a href="#config-file-examples">Config file examples</a>).
###Workflow & Project Sanitation
* Ignore config files in version control (.gitignore for git) since you'll likely not want to share login info in version control.
If you want to leave the configs in version control then you should at least ignore the asc.conf symlink to avoid unnecessary noise
* Any non apex files you wish to put into version control along with your apex app should be placed in a project-top-level dir called non-apex
* After merging your code you should `npm run file-to-apex` and test that the merge didn't break anything
If you have automated tests you can just run those instead
* It is good practice to start your day with a merge

## Configuration
Config files are placed in a top level config/ directory.
Each developer has their own config file with their app data which is then refrenced by a symlink named `asc.conf` (short for apex-source-control.conf).
Config files should not be put under version control (unless you want to share connection data for some reason).
##### apexappid
The unique application id # of your APEX app in Oracle.
Used to tell APEX which application to export.

The application id does not have to already exist in APEX in order to be installed by `npm run file-to-apex` but must not conflict with an app id in a different workspace.
It can be the same as a pre-existing APEX app in the same workspace, but be careful about overwriting work that isn't your own.
##### workspace_name
Name of the workspace where the app is installed or is to be installed to.
The workspace should already exist before usage
##### parsing_schema
The parsing_schema used by APEX for this app.
If set incorrectly the app may not function at all when imported into APEX.
##### app_alias
The app alias to be used by APEX. Should usually not be set.

Since aliases must be unique within a workspace (and recommended to be unique within an instance) this should only be set for important versions of the app (i.e. production or dev versions).
If this field is left blank an app_alias will be auto-generated ('F' + $apexappid) to avoid conflicts.
##### database_connection
The database_connection info in [JDBC](http://www.orafaq.com/wiki/JDBC) format, i.e. Hostname:Port/SID. Example: `myhost:1521/orcl`.
Used in connect statements such as `sqlplus $username/$password@$database_connection`
##### username
Username of database login
##### password
Password of database login
#### Config file examples
A normal developer config file
```
apexappid=116
workspace_name=TEST_WORKSPACE
parsing_schema=PARSER
app_alias=
database_connection=localhost:1521/xe
username=the_coolest_guy
password=no_really_the_coolest
```
A config file for using `npm run generate-app-id`
```
apexappid=
workspace_name=
parsing_schema=
app_alias=
database_connection=localhost:1521/xe
username=the_coolest_guy
password=no_really_the_coolest
```
A config file for a production version of an app
```
apexappid=113
workspace_name=PROD_APPS
parsing_schema=PARSER
app_alias=Hello_World
database_connection=localhost:1521/xe
username=i_wanna_be_the_very_best
password=that_no_one_ever_was
```
###Known Issues
#### Deleting a page will always win merges
**To Reproduce**: 
* Have two developers working on different versions of an app (i.e. working on different features to be added).
* Developer 1 deletes a page in the app and pushes to the project's repo.
* Developer 2 merges developer 1's changes and decides to keep the deleted page in the merge.
* When developer 2 reinstalls the app into apex the page will still be deleted.

**Why it occurs**:

Since a page was deleted, it's removed from the install.sql script generated by apex. When git sees the merge of the two developers, only one has changed the install.sql script so it automatically applies those changes to the merge meaning the page is no longer called during install so it's never created in your apex application.

**How to avoid**:

Be extremely careful when deleting pages and consult with your teammates first

**How to fix**:

If you do end up accidently deleting a page then you will have to manually re-add the install lines to the install.sql

#### Random version control noise in application meta-data
On every commit there will be conflicts within the create_application.sql (and likely some others) which will have to be resolved by hand.
Unfortunately there is no easy way to avoid this, but as you continue to use this tool you'll be able to quickly identify which files have real changes and which are garbage.

## Inspiration
These scripts were designed using [this paper] (http://www.rwijk.nl/AboutOracle/psdua.pdf) as reference.
There's a lot of good information about directory structure and general developer workflow so it's definitely worth a read.

It should be noted that if you decide to read the paper we have changed the names/functions of the scripts slightly: file-to-apex=install_apex.sql; uninstall-apex=uninstall_apex.sql; and apex-to-file=apexupdate.sh (Except we don't auto-update using subversion in order to leave more user freedom)

## Developers
To release:

 - update the version in package.json
 - tag with matching tag.  E.g. `git tag -a v1.3.2`
 - deploy to npm repo `npm publish`
